## Overall Reflections

**BRAHMA** So from the melodies that we demonstrated, there are a couple of observations that I think are worth jotting down.  

**KRISHNA** Yes and at the same time, one has to work hard to be data-driven in an imperative/object-oriented paradigm, whereas it with array-oriented paradigm being data-driven is the starting point.  In fact, trying to be object-oriented or imperative would be difficult with array-oriented paradigm.  This is strikingly similar to the mutability and immutability in imperative/OO and FP paradigm.  One has to work hard to stay immutable in imperative paradigm, whereas its where FP paradigm begins.  In the FP paradigm, one has to work hard to achieve mutability.
