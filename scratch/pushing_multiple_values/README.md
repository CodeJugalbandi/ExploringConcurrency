# Functional Programming Meets Reactive Programming (Pushing Multiple Values)

In this melody, we will look at how FP meets reactive programming wherein events are pushed towards the observers.

## Problem Statement

We will demonstrate this using problem statement - Given a bunch of stocks in user's portfolio, user subscribes to receiving price updates for them in real-time:

* We need to add 2% brokerage to every price that the user sees.
* Allow user to set a threshold for the Networth of the portfolio.  20% drop or rise in its Networth results in sending an alert.
